# 🎨 Scrooch 3 Modding Template

Welcome to your **Scrooch 3 Modding Template!**
This project makes it super easy to create your own custom Scratch 3 mod — tweak visuals, logic, styles, and more — all using **GitHub Pages** and your browser.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Duplicate this repo** 👉 [Click Here to Duplicate](https://github.com/new?template_name=Scrooch3-Template&template_owner=Noahscratch493&use_v2_form=false)
2. In your new repo, go to **Settings > Pages**, and set the source to the `main` branch and the `/ (root)` folder.
3. GitHub will give you a URL like:
   `https://your-username.github.io/your-mod-name` (If it doesn't work, try turning on GitHub Pages in Settings)
   (This will use **whatever name you gave it** while duplicating!)

Now you're running your own Scratch 3 mod right from the browser! 🎉

## 🖼️ Editing Images (Beginner-Friendly)

If you're new to modding, start by customizing images!

Look inside:

* `/images/`
* `/static/`

You can change lots in these folders!

🧰 Tools to use:

* [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) (works in browser)
* Paint.NET or GIMP

📝 Keep image sizes and names the same unless you know how to adjust the layout.

---

## 💻 JavaScript Modding (Advanced)

If you want to change how Scratch behaves, explore the JavaScript in /js/!

🔍 You can also open DevTools (F12) in your browser to test code on the fly.

---

## 🎨 CSS Styling (Advanced)

You can fully restyle the Scratch interface:

* Look for `.css` or `.scss` files in `gui/`
* Customize fonts, colors, borders, and spacing
* Use browser DevTools to preview changes instantly

Try making your own custom theme — like neon, retro, or minimalistic!

---

## 🧱 HTML Tweaks (Advanced)

Even though Scrooch 3 runs on React, the main `.html` files are editable.

Use it to:

* Change the page title
* Add a custom favicon
* Load Google Fonts or extra scripts

---

## 💡 Extra Tips

* Keep testing in the browser as you make changes
* Save backups before doing big edits
* Try creating a themed mod like **Scratch Green**, **Scratch Retro**, or **Scratch Mobile-Lite**
